Crowd-source questions for a meetup. Building a set of API endpoints where the users can vote on asked questions and they bubble to the top or bottom of the log.

# Required Features
1. Admin can create meet ups.
2. Users can create an account and log in.
3. Users can post questions to a specific meet up.
4. Users can up vote or down vote a question.
5. Questions are sorted based on the number of up votes a question has, which helps the meet up organizer(s) to prioritize questions most users are interested in.
6. Users can post comments to a specific question.

# Setting up your system

Make sure you already have Python3, Pip and Virtualenv installed in your system.

# How to get started

Start by making a directory where we will work on. Simply Open your terminal and then:

```
mkdir Questioner-ADC
```

Afterwhich we go into the directory:

```
cd Questioner-ADC
```

## Create a Python Virtual Environment for our Project

Since we are using Python 3, create a virtual environment by typing:

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

Before we install our project's Python requirements, we need to activate the virtual environment. You can do that by typing:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Clone and Configure a Flask Project

Login into your github account and open the project folder then follow the instruction on how to clone the existing project. It should be something similar to:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bakley/Questioner-ADC.git
```

Next, install the requirements by typing:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run the app

### Scenario 1

Install dotenv file

```
pip install -U python-dotenv
```

We add the new package to the requirements file.

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

We make sure that we wonâ€™t add it to the source code version control adding it to .gitignore:


```
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

Add the following file on .env
```
source venv/bin/activate
export  FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_APP=run.py
```

### Scenario 2

On the terminal type:

```
export  FLASK_ENV=development
```

```
export FLASK_APP=run.py
```

```
flask run
```

## Unit Testing
To test the endpoints ensure that the following tools are available the follow steps below
   ### Tools:
     Postman

### Commands
  The application was tested using `nose` and coverage. To run the tests on the bash terminal use

     nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=app  && coverage report
